    <h1>Present-tense. A Buddhist Meditation on the Bardo of Death.</h1>
    <img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*SF_PO6HoxLJEiwslJaoLGQ.jpeg">
    <p>My Mother is dying, present-tense.</p>
    <p>Her time here in this realm of existence will soon be over. I have many thoughts— as a son, a buddhist and a man. If only to assuage my feelings of grief a bit and to avoid relying too much on others, I have been writing them down, since June. I do not wish to avoid the reality of her impending death and my relationship with her, quite to to contrary — I wish to learn from it, especially now.</p>
    <p>I have relied on one central teaching for a very long time now — the First Noble Truth of Buddhism, which says simply that desire — <i> specifically for things to be different </i>, is the cause of all suffering. Indeed, Gautama the Buddha’s own awakening began with the realization that there is no avoiding sickness, old age and death. All of us falter in our acceptance of this truth at one time or another.</p>
    <p>I certainly do on a regular basis and more so lately.</p>
    <p>My Mum has progressive super-nuclear palsy, a degenerative disorder affecting the brain, <i>and</i> stomach cancer. The doctors found the latter condition because the former causes problems in swallowing, speech and aspiration. On Memorial Day weekend, my mother choked on <i>hot-dog</i>, and her heart stopped. I find it painfully ironic that the last solid food my American-Italian Mother ate was a <i> hot-dog</i>. My father could not resuscitate her and she slipped into a coma. When they attempted to insert a feeding tube — they found cancer. I didn’t know about the incident nor her condition until a few days later when my brother called.</p>
    <p>I took the call and promptly went to the bed. I got up and out to pee, work out, and eat — but mostly I laid in bed and meditated. Not a very “manly” thing to do in the face of death, is it. My brother would call and tell me what was going on. Friends, some former partners, colleagues were sympathetic but mostly there was awkwardness around my grief, my anger, tearfulness, weakness and vulnerability. I am referring to my own awkwardness, by the way. I learned very quickly that if I was going to learn from this process— I’d have to rely on my practice, not people’s words or reactions or even their support. The mistakes I have made over the past four months have come from moving away from my practice and grasping for understanding <i>from</i> others.</p>
    <p>I eventually got on my feet. I’m a “man” after all. “Get out of bed,” said the <i>“man”</i> inside the man.</p>
    <p>There were strange coincidences. When my Mother renamed one of the orderlies who looked after her in the IC, “Leonardo,” I was reading Walter Isaacson’s new biography of Leonardo Da Vinci. When she was diagnosed with stomach cancer I was doubled over in pain. Does this mean anything? Is it because scientists have discovered there is a little bit of me left in my Mum? I suppose I could choose to ignore these odd things, and say that these are just mere coincidences — but they are not. My Mum will most certainly leave this life in the next few months. There is nothing special about her illness, except that she is my Mother, and it will be her last illness.</p>
    <p>Tibetan Buddhist yogis tell us that at the time before death, many doors open to knowledge and other worlds — these are temporary, mental places we visit before rebirth called  <i> <a href="https://www.lionsroar.com/four-points-for-letting-go-bardo/"> bardo. </a> </i>  Our ability to simultaneously let go, and navigate the bardo of death is based on our familiarity with the deep recesses of the primordial mind — most especially, how we experience <i> pain, suffering and loss. </i> From the base of the mind called <i>rigpa,</i> connections and new karma can arise, lessons can be absorbed, a voice can be heard. Esoteric practitioners believe we will encounter an array of beings in the bardo, some with an axe to chop off our head, while another may transforms into a lotus-bearing <i>goddess</i> — all based on the quality of our mind. The essential teaching of the bardo is that when we experience this kind of loss, or break in the continuity of our experience, it feels like we are entombed between death and rebirth. We must reshape our minds, and become comfortable with dis-ease, dis-comfort, and eventually death itself.</p>

    <p>Death is a tremendously important teaching. In the Zen tradition I have my most of my formal practice training in — we refer to this as the “great conversation”, while the Tibetan <i>Nyingma </i> tradition I belong to, there are specific practices that help us understand impermanence. Over the past six months, I have been enmeshed in this conversation. I am finishing an elaborate, half-body tattoo, and due to my Mother’s illness, I have had plenty of time to meditate on pain, suffering and loss. Not coincidentally, the main subject of my back piece is the Bodhisattva <i> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%E1%B9%A3itigarbha"> Kstsigharba,</a> </i> the protector of children, women, and guide to the deceased between lives.</p>

    <img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*wckOyhRMI6uY4I8UUEu0xQ.png">

    <p>I believe that what I can endure gracefully and consciously strengthens my <i> bodhicitta </i> — the inherent buddha-hood we all possess. I also believe that what I am impatient with is — an even more better teacher. Nothing is left out, and everything is valuable. I hope to skillfully orientate my “self” to trauma, pain, and death. A calibration that in no small way — prepares me to enter into the second act of my life as I approach fifty, a period of time that will surely involve more suffering, death, and illness. My tattooing experience and my grief about my Mother’s imminent passing are unique <i>bardo.</i> </p>
    <p>Time on the tattoo table really isn’t any different from time on the zafu. I’m dealing with my body and my brain as I pass through a tiny bardo of people chattering, needles whirring, loud music, and of course my skin being inserted with ink. We can and do choose pain…the <i> real </i> question is first, what is the real pain in our lives — and second, do we wish to experience pain in a way that creates beauty and power or do we let pain overwhelm us? When I sit down on my meditation cushion, I zoom in on what hurts — what feels like crap. I follow the breath and ask — what is <i> this?</i> </p>
    <p>When my Mother was given six months to live, I knew that the entire process was going to deepen everything — and loosen everything. I need to pay as close attention to my process as I had while being tattooed, and while sitting zazen. Zen teachers call this “bringing your practice into your life”, or in this case — into death. I zoomed in. I asked (of her illness and death) — what is <i>this?</i> </p>
    <p>I am more prepared than I may have thought — and still, I made mistakes. I did not pay close enough attention. I reached outside of my own experience for understanding. I reached out to others not equipped nor interested in helping me. Many readers will decry this statement — of course we need others — they should have been there for you! I happen to agree with you, but that was not the lesson this time.</p>
    <p>My family is made up of three older siblings and my Dad. We are all, naturally in shock, often contentious, and not doing so well. Everything that was dysfunctional to begin with is now even more so — that includes my own behavior. I have not handled certain moments well. I blew up my ex’s phone expecting that <i>she</i> could help me, that she <i>should</i> talk to me— when I knew from experience with her that this was definitely not a good idea. I fell backwards into old habits and unskillful ways of communicating.</p>
    <p>I resisted entering the bardo.</p>

    <p> <i> <b>Lesson: Death cannot be made “pretty” or sterilized or gentle. It is reasonable to expect the absolute utter worst during a time of death. Even a person with training in meditation can make errors and fall prey to illusion, expectations and the like. Do not beat yourself up about it.</b> </i> </p>
    <p>A parent’s demise is a powerful bardo — an opening to huge lessons. The most important amongst them is forgiveness. As a family, we have long been estranged from one another. I am not sure we will grow any closer now — but I would like to think we can create some peace. Unfortunately, that is not unfolding, and that too, is a lesson. We cannot change people.</p>
    <p>My mother is eighty, she is frail, hungry, cannot swallow or speak terribly well and just got over pneumonia. We did not think she should have radiation treatments for fear of them making her condition worse — and of course, she decided she wants them because she’d have to get better to die.When I told my therapist — (who is fortunately a fellow practitioner) about my mother, he sighed and said, “Well, sounds like you are entering into the bardo of mourning.”</p>
    <p>A Matsuo Basho poem came to mind as I walked out of his office into the fall light.</p>
    <p> <i> <b>The temple bell stops — 
        but the sound keeps coming
        out of the flowers.
        The contrail dissipates — 
        but the sound keeps coming
        out of the sky.</b> </i></p>
    <p>My therapist once said to me that the best place to start is from the perspective that whatever we are doing, we likely have a damn good reason for doing it. Think about that one.</p>
    <p>As is often the case when the shit hits the fan, we morph into the anxious, codependent child — needful of attention, grasping for love, security and safety. Surprise! It’s the same pitiable role that I played in my family dynamic. Mind you — I chose that role and have played it extremely well for a long time. I might regret it, but I’m not going to deny it. Just to be clear, the dynamic I am talking about is different than what is being touted by identity politicians lately, specifically…”Men hold the world hostage to their fragility and vulnerability — making female pain the inevitable cost of their comfort”.</p>
    <p>I am held anyone hostage by the illusion of “self.” I’m not holding anyone else hostage to my process — as far as I know.</p>
    <p><i><b>Lesson: Accept, do not blame those who do not have the inclination, time, consideration or empathy to deal with you. There is nothing wrong with them — and there is nothing wrong with you hurting and needing either. However, expectations will never serve us.</b></i></p>
    <p>My first goal, of course, is to remain in my body and avoid drinking myself into the gutter, my second goal is, of course, to understand. Slowing down to mourn the loss of another human being, never mind one’s own Mother is about as antithetical to the bloody rush of modern “reality” as possible. And that is where I’d like to be — vested in a true hope for my Mother that she has the right transition — and that is all I wish. My concern for me is that I remain present for my own experience.</p>
    <p>One of the most poignant memories I have of studying Buddhism was when I was introduced to the mustard seed parable. The mustard seed revolves around a woman named <i>Kisa Gotami</i> whose young son died.</p>

    <img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*ROchUOZYY1BGQrz2otrCqg.jpeg">

    <p>The story goes that Kisa hauled the corpse of her son along with her, and pleaded with the Buddha to bring him back to life. The Buddha paused for a while before instructing Kisa to go back to her village and gather mustard seeds, but only from the households of those who have never been touched by the death. From those mustard seeds, he promised Kisa, he would create a medicine to bring her son back to life.As one might expect, all of her neighbors were willing to give her mustard seeds, but they all told her that all of them had been touched by death one time or another. “The living are few, but the dead are many, ” her wise friends incanted. As the moon came up, the sad mother was still without any of the mustard seeds that she had been instructed to collect, but she realized the teaching of impermanence as quickly as she opened herself up to the notion that she really wasn’t alone at all as she wept. Everyone experiences suffering.</p>
    <p>The perennial questions have not changed since the time of the Buddha, but the context of inquiry has. We do not live in small villages, nor practice the same religion. We do not honor death. We barely discuss the end of a loved one. Today, some even say there will be a cure for death brought to us by artificial intelligence. In other words, whatever concept of immateriality and impermanence that existed in the fifth century BCE is different than how you and I might consider it.</p>
    <p>My well-meaning friends are bewildered when I tell them my mother is dying. They skip over it in a few sentences. They ask the obvious question, the one I am asking myself — when will you visit her?</p>
    <p>First, I have not had any semblance of a real relationship with my mother in a very long time. That was by choice — a poor one at that. I saw my Mother in the summer of 2011, but not since. She was sitting in an upright beach-chair next to my Father momentarily, both of them gripping a tumbler filled with vodka as if they had the habit to do — for nearly forty years. There was very little to talk about — and quickly, automatically I tried to save the situation by cracking jokes, making things up, getting them to laugh. But it didn’t work. I was not drinking, and the invitation to enjoy “shrimp cocktail by the pool” extended by my older brother hadn’t materialized. He was inside on his phone, talking to a client. So much for “family time.”</p>
    <p>Later on, as they took their positions in front of the television, I got up, wished them the best and walked out the door to car service waiting in the driveway. I have not seen them since. In the summer of 2014, I was living in a village in Italy finishing my first novel. I wrote my parents a nasty email. I explained how I felt that my childhood was stupendously shitty and all the ways <i>they</i> had fucked up. Four years later, I regret that. I chose to channel regret and my own lack of healing at people not equipped to do anything about it, or even process the information. My actions were stupid and selfish. Again, I was looking for someone <i>else</i> to assuage what is going on with <i>me.</i></p>
    <p>There is nothing romantic about seeing a parent’s light fade out. There is a lot of ugliness in all of this — a lot of tubes, and machines and smells and memories that I did not want to dredge up like the clams I dug with my uncles years ago on the beach. Foremost amongst all this is the simple fact that the primary dynamic of my family has and always will be one of dysfunction.</p>
    <p>Contrary to Dr. Phil and every other charlatan making millions off the woes of others — most broken families <i>stay</i> broken. Even when apologies are uttered and wounds given a goodly balm of therapy and time — things are left as they were found, in a painful void. The squeaky wheel, whatever it might be, alcohol, abuse, mental illness, tends to go right on squeaking for the unfortunate families that cannot muster cooperation amongst themselves or from support groups or therapists.</p>
    <p>Oddly enough, a sort of calm has descended as of late.</p>
    <p>Equanimity signals an acceptance of my powerlessness in the face of everything that is unfolding. Assurance comes from inwardly knowing that at this stage of my life, at this stage of my own evolution, — pain, death, and mourning do not need to “spin me out.” That does not mean that I am ignoring them — quite to the contrary, I feel every needle prick, every sound. Owning my pain, owning my experience also means that my lamp is my own— and that I needn’t reach out to anyone for succor.</p>
    <p><i><b>“The same wind that picks up the leaf on one side of the mountain moves the clouds over the valley.”</b></i></p>
    <p>I accept the inevitability of my Mother’s death by admitting that I am most certainly going to be in pain about it now, present tense. Instead of desperately reaching out, I go in, instead of running, I prepare. Instead of numbing, I wake up. Instead of bracing for impact, I let go of mt body like I did when as a surfer — entangled in a quantum foam, I wipe-out, I let go, I let go…</p>
    <p><i>I let go.</i></p>
