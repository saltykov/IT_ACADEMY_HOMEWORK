    <center><p><h2>Present-tense. A (non) Buddhist Guide to the Death of a Parent</h2></p></center>
</header>
<main>
    <p>Right now, as I am writing this piece and you are reading it, my Mother is dying. Present-tense. I began this piece in June, and have waited this long to publish it.There is no avoiding it any longer, although I believe part of me very much and quite reasonably wants to.</p>
    <p>On Memorial Day weekend, my mother choked on hot-dog, and her heart stopped. My father could not resuscitate her and she slipped into a coma. I didn’t know about the incident until the next day when my brother called me. Of course, I nearly lost my shit. We knew that she was suffering from dementia or something akin to it — hence the swallowing issues. When she came out of the coma, she received another diagnosis — stomach cancer. I was in bed, worn out for about three days. My brother would call and tell me what was going on. When she renamed one of the orderlies who looked after her, “Leonardo,” I was reading Walter Isaacson’s new biography of Leonardo Da Vinci.</p>
    <p>What do these synchronicities mean, if anything? Is it because as scientists have discovered there is a little bit of me left in my Mum? I suppose I could choose to ignore these odd things, and say that these are just mere coincidences — but they are not. These connections have meaning.</p>
    <p>Tibetan Buddhist yogis tells us that at the time of death, a door to knowledge is opened to another world — sometimes a temporary one before rebirth called a <i>bardo</i>. Our ability to correctly navigate these spaces is based on our familiarity with the deep recesses of the primordial mind — most especially, how we experience <i>pain</i>. From a calm base, connections and new karma can arise, lessons can be absorbed, the voice can be heard. If a being experiences a good, conscious death, they everyone around them is affected by it.</p>
    <p>I began to meditate on pain and on death in June for obvious reasons. Over the past year, I have also been finishing an elaborate tattoo. I have plenty of time to think about pain. I have had the somewhat odd desire to have a Japanese “body-suit” for twenty years and have been completing it ever since. Not coincidentally, the main subject of my back piece is the Bodhisattva <i>Kstisgharba</i>, the protector of children, women, and guide to the deceased between lives.</p>

    <p>I rarely talk about, never mind openly display my tattoos, but recently, a brave soul passing by me while I was working out asked, “Why would you do all that to your body?” It’s a legitimate question and one I’d been turning over in my mind ever since I started. I don’t know why anyone else is doing this, that’s none of my business. Let me dismiss a myth. Tattooing a significant portion of your human body takes too much effort, time, and money for it to be reduced to “Oh, this looks badass.”</p>

        since the physical brain is the font of the mind,
        everything, too, is the body.

    <p>The process of Japanese tattooing is long and often extraordinarily painful. Of course, it is also entirely deliberate, and self-inflicted. I choose.</p>
